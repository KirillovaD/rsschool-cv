## About me

I am a junior frontend developer.

My goal is to give a try for making people's life easier and comfy. I'd like to take part in the creation and/or development client-oriented products.

My priorities are doing my best and don't stop to learn. I search for meanings in what I do and would work hard if it make sense for people and reaches meaningful goals.

I have experience in different fields so it gave me the opportunity to broaden my horizons and taught to step outside
my comfort zones and become more flexible.

My university education and work experience as a manager allows me not only organize and communicate but also understand the needs of customers and clients.

Also, I have a degree in graphic design that's helped me to be creative and have a vision of the entire work.

I do not accept any type of aggression.
